        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Become a "signor developer", get as many big and smart dogs as possible, visit at least 50 different countries.</p>
        <h2>Boigraphy</h2>
        <p>Last year she graduated from St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.  I currently work as a junior frontend developer.  The main responsibilities include the layout of sites and landing pages, writing scripts in JS.  I develop the skills necessary for a frontend developer and bring sweets to my colleagues.  I want to find a job with the opportunity to further develop and learn something new in this area.
I am easily addicted to work in which the result is clearly visible, which is why I chose web development.  I easily get in contact with people, but I try, if possible, not to mix personal contacts with workers.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>She graduated from the bachelor's degree at the Institute of Physics, Nanotechnology and Telecommunications.

Completed courses in front-end development</p>
